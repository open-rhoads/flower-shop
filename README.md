# Flower Shop
This project uses the Bootstrap CSS framework for a flower shop eCommerce website. This project started out as a hard-coded front-end using SCSS. 

## Updated Color Theme
One of my greatest flaws as an early web developer was loving color a bit too much. This site previously had a lively and arguably distarcting bright pink and purple theme that I have scaled back significantly. This was a great way to review SCSS. A lot of the other styling too needed to be modernized.

## Dynamic Content
This project also suffers from bloated HTML. It has a products page in particular that could be re-factored to be much more dynamic. I will start by trying to code the functionality using an object of products. 

## Adding a Functional Cart Back End
My last enhancement to this will be to actually hook it up to a database of products and make it function by implementing Express.js with SQLLite database.
